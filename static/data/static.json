    "options": {
      "A": "To assign responsibility",
      "B": "To track deliverables",
      "C": "To ensure profitability",
      "D": "To allocate risk between buyer and seller"
    },
    "answer": "The correct answer is D because a contract's primary purpose is to allocate risk between the buyer and the seller. A is incorrect because assigning responsibility is a function of the contract, but not its main goal. B is incorrect as tracking deliverables is a project management function, not a contract function. C is incorrect because ensuring profitability is a business outcome, not a legal intent of a contract.",
    "examCue": "Look for phrases like 'primary purpose' or 'contract objective' â€” these usually point to risk allocation rather than deliverables or profitability.",
